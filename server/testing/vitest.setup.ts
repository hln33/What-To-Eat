/**
 * Make sure that there is a `.env.test` file that specifies the name of the test database.
 * This will be the database created and used for tests.
 *
 * NOTE:
 * Tests may fail unexpectedly after a hot module reload.
 * I.e., after modifying a file and saving it while in watch mode.
 *
 * This is suspected to happen because the process does not have time to fully
 * release the database lock before the next one starts.
 * However, when a "fresh" test run is initiated, there is enough time to release any locks.
 *
 * To workaround this, simply rerun the tests manually by pressing `r` or `a`.
 * Possible future solutions may be to:
 *   1. provide each individual test with its own db file or in-memory db.
 *      This can be combined with dependency injection to make sure right db is being used.
